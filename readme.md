This project was a quick for fun one from a few years ago and I got recently asked if I was willing to open source it. I would assume the code is messy and abilities etc. are not all there anymore (since the Splinterlands game has grown). If someone wants to improve upon the project, feel free to. 

Things you might want to do:
- Design overhaul
- Code clean up
- Adding missing abilities etc.

Plans I had for the project at one point:
- Golden cards
- One click export (img for each lvl + stats)
- Custom abilities
- Save your card
- See other created cards 
- Upvote other card creations using Hiveconnect
